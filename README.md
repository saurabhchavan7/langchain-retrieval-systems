# LangChain Retrieval Systems

This folder contains structured learning and implementations around **retrieval systems using LangChain**.

The goal of this section is to understand and build **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines step by step, starting from core concepts and moving towards complete, production-style retrieval systems.

The folder is organized to reflect how retrieval systems are actually built in practice component by component.

---

## What This Folder Covers

This section focuses on:

- Understanding how retrieval systems work in LLM-based applications
- Learning how external knowledge is connected to language models
- Implementing individual retrieval components in isolation
- Gradually composing these components into full retrieval pipelines

---

## What Will Be Added Here

As this section grows, it will include:

- Document ingestion pipelines
- Text splitting strategies
- Embedding generation workflows
- Vector database integrations
- Retriever implementations
- End-to-end RAG pipelines
- Experiments and comparisons across retrieval approaches

Each subfolder focuses on **one retrieval concept at a time**, with clear code examples and minimal abstractions.
